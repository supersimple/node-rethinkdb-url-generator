# url-generator

## Node.js, Express, RethinkDB based URL shortener ##
Along with a vanilla JS bookmarklet, this software will create hashed URLs and add them to a rethinkDB database. The database stores a map of URL=>hashedURL and keeps a count of each time the link is clicked on.

### Future Releases ###
* Create a secure web interface to view the links and analytics.
* An easier way to set everything up.
* Build out tests
